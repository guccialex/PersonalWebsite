      <h1>
            Hello, welcome to the website i've made.
          </h1>
      <p>

        Hello. Welcome to the “employability” subpage of the AGUSAIN website.
        <br>You can see my resume <a target="_blank" href="Resume.pdf">here</a>
        <br>
        <br>I that basically touches on everything important, but some other less relevant accomplishments I’ve left out of the summaries are:
        <br>-7/10 (highest in class) on the McMaster Gr 12 physics contest
        <br>-1st in school OAPT Physics Contest
        <br>-$2000 scholarship to NAIMUN event in Washington USA
        <br>
        <br>Maybe I should’ve gone into some physics program eh? Well, the great thing about Uni is that it lets me still take physics while in the CS program.
        <br>
        <br>The NAIMUN thing sounds important, but the scholarship was for the attendance for 4 of our club members and I didn’t end up winning anything, so I left it out.
        <br>
        <br>Now I’ll actually talk about what I’ve done, like my Website/Computer Club and how it has prepared me to take part in a work environment.
        <br>I was president of the ACCI Computer Club during grade 11 as well as 12. And in gr 11 it functioned as any computer club should. As the president, I was working with the Grade 9's and 10's on programs.
         Mostly just getting them to complete Project Euler problems when I wasn't trying to set up the club Raspberry Pi as a computer. Real fun.
        <br>In grade 12, the principle asked the teachers club supervisor and CS department head about creating a new website for the school. And since he couldn’t give administrative permission of the site to people he didn’t trust,
        he turned the computer club partially into the website design club for us to work on. I supervised the creation of the site that me and 2.5 others worked on. And over the year, we got together and updated the info from the different departments, the photos, and design for the web pages.
        <br>You can see it here.
        <br><a target="_blank" href="http://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/albertcampbell/">ACCI website</a>
        <br>And you can see me here second from the left.
        <br><a target="_blank" href="http://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/albertcampbell/CLUBS/Webpage-Design">ACCI club page</a>
        <br>
        <br>Overall why should you hire me?
        <br>I am a smart, responsible hard working person who likes being a part of projects. Whether it’s a project i’ve taken upon myself for the sake of interest, or a project larger than that, more concerned with efficiency or money. And I’m reasonable
        and down to earth. And that’s really all there is to it. I have reasonable expectations for putting in work to learn whatever job I will manage to find over this summer, and I apply with that expectation. So if you would like to meet me in person,
        and confirm my intention, please feel free to contact me on my phone or email.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
